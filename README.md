# Tech Event Review

#### AgilePDX, 08/14/2018

#### Attended By Devin Mounts

## This event was a Meetup organized by AgilePDX, Facilitated by Willem Larsen, a senior software developer at Hunter Industries.


## Format & Focus
  The event was a casual discussion and networking gathering, exploring the topic of Mob-Programming.  The facilitator, Willem, discussed systemic challenges that Hunter Industries had faced in developing quality software applications for their customers.  To solve this issue, Willem expanded on his connection to Agile Project Management, and began organized optional "Mob Programming" events during the work day.  These events were a request to all developers in the company to gather at one computer to tackle major software issues Hunter Industries faced.  The format of Mob Programming placed one developer as the driver, another as the navigator, and included at least on developer in the mob.  Roles were rotated every 3-5 minutes, and every 30 min the team would stop for a 30sec - 1 min. reflection on the cycles progress, and directive for the next cycle.  This approach to solving difficult bugs within the companies software has been very successful and is now integrated into Hunter Industries standard practices.


## Reason for attending & Highlights
  I attended this event because of my interest in learning new ways promoting integrated teams, and innovative approaches to problem-solving in software development.  While I greatly enjoyed the topic of the event, I mostly appreciated the intimate space the gathering provided, as there were less than ten people present.  This allowed me to present questions and actively listen in a space that is conducive to the manner in which I feel most comfortable.  This was a great practice to expand my networking skills in a familiar environment, as I aim to carry this experience to larger networking events that may be more intimidating because of their size.  I learned that people who attend and organize these events are eager to make connections and meet new individuals, like myself, who are taking the leap into the tech industry.

## Feedback
  I would enjoy a mock 'Mob Programming' as part of this event, as to better understand it's process.  I was assured that 'Mob Programming' activities are normal pieces of these gatherings, that certain event was an anomaly.
